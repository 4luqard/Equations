# Equations
This repository is about visualizing some equations as functions and then finding their solutions.

More specifically when I see an equation that I find interesting in my free time I like to use Python to visualize and also solve the equations to see if I solved the equations correctly and to see if I visualized the equations correctly in my mind while solving the equations
